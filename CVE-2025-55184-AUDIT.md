# Security Audit Report: CVE-2025-55184 & CVE-2025-55183

**Date:** 2025-12-12
**Project:** reinvented-wheel-of-names
**Auditor:** Jules (AI Software Engineer)

## Executive Summary

This report details the security audit performed to assess the impact of **CVE-2025-55184 (Denial of Service)** and **CVE-2025-55183 (Source Code Exposure)** on the `reinvented-wheel-of-names` project.

**Verdict: SAFE**

The project is running a patched version of Next.js (`16.0.10`) which includes fixes for both vulnerabilities. A deep dependency analysis confirms that no unbundled, vulnerable versions of React Server Components implementation (`react-server-dom-*`) are present in the dependency tree.

## Methodology

The following steps were taken to verify the security posture of the application:

1.  **Version Verification**: Checked the installed versions of `next`, `react`, and `react-dom` against the patched versions listed in the [Vercel Security Bulletin](https://vercel.com/kb/bulletin/security-bulletin-cve-2025-55184-and-cve-2025-55183).
2.  **Deep Dependency Analysis**:
    *   Scanned `package-lock.json` for direct or transitive dependencies on `react-server-dom-webpack`, `react-server-dom-parcel`, and `react-server-dom-turbopack`.
    *   Executed `npm list` to verify the runtime dependency tree.
    *   Ensured no third-party libraries were introducing vulnerable unbundled versions of the React Server DOM implementation.

## Findings

### 1. Framework Versions

| Package | Installed Version | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **next** | `16.0.10` | **PATCHED** | Matches the fixed version for the 16.x branch. |
| **react** | `19.2.1` | **REVIEWED** | While listed as affected, Next.js bundles its own internal version of the Server Components runtime. Since `next` is patched, the bundled runtime is safe. |
| **react-dom** | `19.2.1` | **REVIEWED** | Same as above. |

### 2. Dependency Tree Analysis

*   **Search Target**: `react-server-dom-webpack`, `react-server-dom-parcel`, `react-server-dom-turbopack`.
*   **Result**: **0 instances found** in the user-installable dependency tree.
*   **Analysis**: The project relies entirely on the Next.js bundled implementation of React Server Components. Since the `next` package is updated to `16.0.10`, the bundled implementation contains the necessary security patches. No external libraries are pulling in vulnerable versions.

## Conclusion

The application is **not vulnerable** to CVE-2025-55184 or CVE-2025-55183. The upgrade to Next.js `16.0.10` has been successfully verified, and no conflicting dependencies introduce risk.

## Recommendations

*   **Maintain Updates**: Continue to monitor Vercel security bulletins and keep Next.js updated.
*   **Vercel Deployment Protection**: Ensure "Standard Protection" is enabled on Vercel deployments as an extra layer of defense, as recommended in the bulletin.
